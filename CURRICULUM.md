## Lessons ##

### Lesson 1: scripting ###

before class read:
https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/Scientific-Computing-Workshop-E21/blob/main/day-1-oop/day-1.1-morning.md
and do some simple exercise?

1) Introduction to cloud computing with UCloud
    - Persistence, mounting folder
2) Introduction to CLI

3) Exercises Data types


After the class the student should be able to:

    - 
3) Be able to work with objects such as `str, list, tuples, dictionaries, bool, float, ints` 
    - be able to run script from the shell
