### Lesson 3: Modular Code development
<!-- Lasse -->
<!-- IM kan ikke være der -->
**Time**: Monday, March 7, 08.00-10.00

**Location**: 1441 - 012, Aud 1

**Readings before class**:
[Modules and Packages](https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/scientific-computing-01/blob/main/readings/class3_modules.md)
Please make sure to complete the exercises from week 2 before this class.

#### Content of the class
1) Working with modules/libraries
- Know what a module is and how to import and use them in Python
- How to install libraries using `pip`
- Be familiar with virtual environments and understand their use

2) Creating a module
- Know how to create re-usable functions
- Best practice when developing re-usable functions/modules (docstrings, type hints, descriptive variable names)

<!-- import i R -->


<!-- prøv at load en pakke der ikke er installeret -> error -> gå i terminal -> pip install -> snak om nice med requirements.txt og venvs.. Giver mindre mening på ucloud, mere lokalt 

best practice med modules: docstrings, type hints, iterative development (små funktioner)
modules: os, time, numpy (pandas)
virtual environments (step by step guide)
